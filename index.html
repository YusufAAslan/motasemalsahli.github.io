					Photoshop’, today is the most popular and profitable application that supports layers, filters, brushes, text, 3D objects, videos, etc. Photoshop is mainly used for bitmap image and to do image manipulation tasks effectively. At the beginning, Photoshop was known as “Display” to show grayscale images on a monochrome display. 
					n 1987, Thomas Knoll, a PhD student at the University of Michigan, found out that his new Mac Plus (third model of computer in Macintosh line) failed to display grayscale images on its 1-bit black and white display.

					To crack this disadvantage of Mac Plus, Thomas began coding a program that could solve the problem.

					Then his brother, John Knoll, who was in charge of the special effects department for Industrial Light and Magic on the 1st Star Wars movie showed interest in the project and recommended that it be developed into a full image editing program. Hence it was named ‘Display’. The Knoll brothers then renamed Display to Image-Pro. Image-Pro could be used for rack card printing too and that wasn’t the only thing it could do.

					Image-Pro had many advanced features for displaying images so in the year 1988, Knoll brothers started to sell Image-Pro commercially. And for this purpose they renamed Image-Pro to “Photoshop”.

					The Knoll brothers approached many companies, but none of them were ready to purchase Photoshop. In Sept. 1988, a deal was struck between the Knoll brothers and Adobe. All the wholesale rights of Photoshop were purchased by Adobe. The Knoll brothers started working on their product and released the first version Photoshop 1.0 in 1990.

					So up to this, you have seen the development and Journey of “Display”-“Image-Pro” to “Photoshop.” Now you will see the development of Photoshop versions from the beginning.
