				In the beginning

By 1987, John Knoll was working at Industrial Light and Magic - Lucasfilm's nascent special effects division, founded for Star Wars - while Thomas was studying for his Ph.D. on image processing at the University of Michigan. Having just bought a brand-new Apple Mac Plus to help out with his thesis, he was dismayed to find it couldn't display greyscale images on the monochrome monitor. So, in true hacker style, he set about writing his own code to do the job.

Unsurprisingly, John was also working on image processing at ILM, and during a holiday visit he became very impressed with Thomas's progress. In the book CG 101: A Computer Graphics Industry Reference, John says: "As Tom showed me his work, it struck me how similar it was to the image-processing tools on the Pixar [a custom computer used at ILM]." Thus the pair began to collaborate on a larger, more cohesive application, which they dubbed - excitingly - Display.

It wasn't long before John had bought a new colour Macintosh II and persuaded Thomas to rewrite Display to work in colour. Indeed, the more John saw of Display, the more features he began to ask for: gamma correction, loading and saving other file formats, and so on.
